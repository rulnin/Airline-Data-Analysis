# ✈️ Airline Data Analysis
This project demonstrates advanced SQL skills through the analysis of airline operational data. It includes queries to determine flight seat availability, booking patterns, aircraft usage, and more. The dataset mimics real-world airline systems, such as ticketing, boarding, and scheduling.

## 📌 Objectives
* Analyze flight data to derive operational insights.
* Determine seat availability and booking trends.
* Practice writing optimized, readable, and accurate SQL queries.
* Simulate data-driven decisions in airline management.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Language: SQL
* Visualization: (Optional) Metabase / Power BI / Tableau
* Environment: pgAdmin / DBeaver / SQL Server Management Studio

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview
The project uses a relational database that includes the following tables:
* flights: Flight schedule and aircraft info.
* seats: Seat layout per aircraft.
* boarding_passes: Passenger seat assignments.
* aircrafts_data: Aircraft specifications.
* ticket_flights, tickets, bookings: Booking and ticketing details.

## 📊 Key Analyses
1. Available Seats on Specific Flights
   Identify how many seats remained unoccupied for flight PG0404 on the second-to-last flight date.
2. Aircraft Utilization
   Analyze which aircraft models are used most frequently.
3. Passenger Load Factor
   Calculate the ratio of booked seats to total available seats per flight.
4. Booking Behavior
   Track booking trends by route, season, and advance booking window.
5. Revenue Estimation (optional)
   Estimate potential and actual revenues based on ticket prices and seat occupancy.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
* Strengthened understanding of complex SQL logic.
* Improved ability to translate business questions into data-driven insights.
* Gained experience working with normalized relational datasets.
